**Problem**
Paper-Rock-Scissors is a game for two players. Each player simultaneously opens his/her hand to display
a symbol:
• Fist equals rock
• Open hand equals paper
• Showing the index and middle finger equals scissors.

The winner is determined by the following schema:
• Paper beats (wraps) rock
• Rock beats (blunts) scissors
• Scissors beats (cuts) paper.

Write a program that plays Paper-Rock-Scissors between the computer and a real player. You should be
able to play the game n times before the program exits.
